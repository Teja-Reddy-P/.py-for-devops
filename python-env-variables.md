Python environment variables are variables in the operating system that can affect the behavior of the Python interpreter and scripts. These variables can be used to set configuration settings and provide information to programs. Environment variables are often used to control the settings for the Python runtime and other programs.
Accessing Environment Variables in Python::::
You can access environment variables in your Python scripts using the os module.

import os

# Accessing an environment variable
python_path = os.getenv('PYTHONPATH')
print(f"PYTHONPATH: {python_path}")

# Setting an environment variable within the script
os.environ['MY_VARIABLE'] = 'my_value'
print(f"MY_VARIABLE: {os.getenv('MY_VARIABLE')}")


Example Usage of Environment Variables:::::
Suppose you have a script that depends on a specific configuration file path. You can use an environment variable to specify the path dynamically.

import os

config_path = os.getenv('CONFIG_PATH', '/default/path/to/config')
print(f"Using config file at: {config_path}")


You can set the CONFIG_PATH environment variable before running the script:


export CONFIG_PATH=/custom/path/to/config
python my_script.py


Conclusion::::
Python environment variables provide a flexible way to configure the behavior of Python applications and the Python interpreter. They can be used to set paths, customize initialization, and manage runtime settings. Understanding how to set and access environment variables can help you manage your Python environment more effectively and write more adaptable and configurable scripts.
